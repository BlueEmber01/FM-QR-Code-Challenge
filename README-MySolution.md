## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This project was a great introduction to HTML and CSS. It allowed me to take some basic principles I had learned in theory and put it into code to create an aesthetically pleasing product. With this project, I learned how to center a div and adjust font weights. As well as the basic of Figma to determine the margins between text and images. 


### Continued development

For future projects, I want to learn how to slim down my css, as I feel it may be a little bulky, particularly when centering a div. I would also like to learn how to make the qr code functional once I have a more solid understanding of html and css.  


### Useful resources

- [11 Ways to Center a Div or Text in a Div in CSS](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) - This helped me learn how to center a div. I liked how it included how to center a div vertically and horizontally seperately and together, which will be useful in the future. It also gave different options on how to center a div and how to center text in a div.
